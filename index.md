### Customer Churn Analysis
Telco is a fictional telecommunications company that loses customers (customer churn). The company currently isn’t able to predict when and why churn happens. We can use artificial intelligence to analyze customer’s behavior, understand which features are important for predicting customer churn, and then predict when a customer is at risk of leaving. 

Nine supervised learning models are used: 
* XGBoost, 
* Random Forest, 
* Decision Tree Classifier, 
* Logistic Regression, 
* Support Vector Machine, 
* Stochastic Gradient Descent, 
* Perceptron, 
* Naïve Bayes, and 
* K Nearest Neighbors
